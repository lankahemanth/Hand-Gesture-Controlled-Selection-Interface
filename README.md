# Hand-Gesture-Controlled-Selection-Interface
This Python program uses a webcam to detect hand gestures. By showing 1, 2 or 3 fingers the user can select different options on the screen. It shows a background and icons, and updates the screen based on the userâ€™s hand gestures. The program uses OpenCV and cvzone for hand tracking and image display.
